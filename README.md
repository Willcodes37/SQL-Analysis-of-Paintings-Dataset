### SQL Final Portfolio Project

The Data
Import the paintings database, [paintings.tar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10axLpX_eyTwqPZFFsIuxqKCKxbWbWXde/view), to Postgres using pgAdmin. Then answer the following questions using SQL. Save the associated queries in a text file. 
The Questions
Create a google doc answering the following questions.

1. What museums have the highest proportion of cubist paintings? What other styles of art do these museums typically display?
2. Which artists have their work displayed in museums in many different countries?
3. Create a table that shows the most frequently painted subject for each style of painting, how many paintings there were for the most frequently painted subject in that style, how many paintings there are in that style overall, and the percent of paintings in that style with the most frequent subject. Exclude cases where there is no information on the subject of the painting. Format the table and copy it into the google doc.
